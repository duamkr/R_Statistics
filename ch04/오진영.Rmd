## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
set.seed(9)
x <- seq(0,500,by=0.001)
mean.4   <- rep(NA, 1000)     # 결측치 생성 
mean.16  <- rep(NA, 1000)
mean.32  <- rep(NA, 1000)
mean.256 <- rep(NA, 1000)

for(i in 1:1000) {         
  mean.4[i]   <- mean(rchisq(4,5))
  mean.16[i]  <- mean(rchisq(16,5))
  mean.32[i]  <- mean(rchisq(32,5))
  mean.256[i] <- mean(rchisq(256,5))
}

c(mean(mean.4), sd(mean.4))
c(mean(mean.16), sd(mean.16))
c(mean(mean.32), sd(mean.32))
c(mean(mean.256), sd(mean.256))

hist(mean.4,prob=T,main="카이제곱분포 df=5, n= 4",
     col="cyan")
x1 <- seq(min(mean.4),max(mean.4),length=1000)
y1 <- dnorm(x1, mean = 1, sd=sqrt(10)/sqrt(4))
lines(x1, y1, lty=2, lwd=2, col="blue")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
